# animescrapper
A small python program, using selenium that searches for all the animes of a certain genre and score >= 6 and gives the user 3 options, watch a random anime, see the top 10 or see the top 100. Currently it only works with Windows.

1) You'll need python to make this program work.
2) You'll have to install Chrome for this program.
3) You'll need to install selenium. Just write "python -m pip install selenium" if you are on windows, or just "pip install selenium" if you're using macOS or Linux.
